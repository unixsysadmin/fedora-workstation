# Fuck you Ansible, I don't understand why this suddenly is required.
# I was using ansible 2.8.2 for a whole day without any issue, and suddenly
# on day 2 I get the error that python2-dnf is not available. An old
# dperecated package on Fedora 30. 
# https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/54855
# WHY DID THIS WORK BEFORE THEN?!
# AND IT IS NOT SOLVED IN 2.8
# SO NOW I NEED THIS STUPID DIRECTORY IN ALL MY PLAYBOOKS?
# FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
